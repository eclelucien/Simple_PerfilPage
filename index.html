		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p class="description">I am a student in Systems Analysis and development, born and raised in Haiti, I was able to make my first
			contact with technology since high school before even going to Brazil. Passionate about all technologies, I
			started my career in web development (Front-end) by creating all kinds of website interfaces to then specify
			myself in mobile development, giving me the mission of developing useful mobile applications for people iof
			my surroundings and around the world. I admit that I like mobile development. As I said before, i currently
			work full time as a mobile developer with flutter. I always have the desire to learn more things every day.
			I like working in a team because it gives me the opportunity to have different perspectives on my work and
			to learn new things. I am passionate about all technologies, but I have a special eye for mobile
			development. Welcome here...
